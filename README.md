# AI-Powered Recipe Generator ðŸ¤–

A modern web application that leverages a large language model API to generate unique recipes based on user-provided ingredients. This project showcases the integration of a front-end interface with a powerful AI model, demonstrating skills in both web development and AI API interaction.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Intelligent Recipe Generation**: Uses a large language model to create recipes, including a title, ingredient list, and step-by-step instructions.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and clean design allows users to easily input ingredients and get a recipe.
* **Asynchronous API Calls**: Implements `async/await` to handle API requests efficiently, providing a smooth user experience.
* **Loading Spinner**: Includes a visual indicator to show the user that the AI is working, improving the user experience during the generation process.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

* **HTML**: For the page structure and user input fields.
* **CSS**: For styling the application to be clean and modern.
* **JavaScript**: The core of the application, handling all user interactions and the API request to the AI model.
* **OpenAI/Google Gemini API**: A third-party service that powers the recipe generation with its language model.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1.  **Get an API Key**: Sign up for an account with OpenAI or Google Gemini and obtain your API key.
2.  **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine.
3.  **Add Your API Key**: Open `script.js` and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual API key.
4.  **Open in Browser**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
